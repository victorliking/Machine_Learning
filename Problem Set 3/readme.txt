###The following files realize classify

adagrad.m perceptron.m perceptron_margin.m winnow.m winnow_margin.m

###The following files realzie count the errors:

adagrad_mistake.m perceptron_margin_mistake.m winnow_mistake.m 
winnow_margin_mistake.m 

###The following files realize the convergence test:

adagrad_convergence.m perceptron_convergence.m perceptron_margin_convergence.m winnow_convergence.m winnow_margin_convergence.m

For the ex1, the test file is test.m and result is in "ex1_result.txt" I write the seperate file to test for the long test time.

For the ex2, the test file is test1. and result is in "ex2_result.txt" I write the seperate file to test for the long test time.

For the ex3, the test file is test2.m and result is in "ex3_result.txt"

For the ex4, the test file is test.m and result is in "ex4_result.txt" I write the seperate file to test for the long test time.
